`./` - Our project source folder.

- `/assets/` - Folder with assets needed for this project.
  - `/src/assets/backgrounds` - Folder with 4 background images (one full-size, one 870px, one 450px, and one 320px).
  - `/src/assets/flags` - Folder with 2 images of flags (German and Italian).
- `index.html` - Our homepage.
- `style.css` - Main style sheet.
- `responsive.css` - A separate style sheet for smaller devices.


Known issues:
The page is not completely design proof, nor entirely mobile friendly.
The latter could be fixed with modifying the responsive.css and possibly creating a separate mobileDeviceFriendly.html file, 
where all the divs in flex would be directioned into rows and not columns.

Fonts could also be fixed / replaced with some which are a bit more appropriate.

In the future I could have also created a translations file and use the strings / translations in it across the whole webpage instead of hardcoding everything.
